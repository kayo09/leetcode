# üéØ WHAT IS THE PROBLEM REALLY ASKING?
Let me break down the core requirements:

Main Operations Needed:
Add tasks for users with priorities
Edit priorities of existing tasks
Remove specific tasks by ID
Execute the HIGHEST priority task globally (across ALL users)
The Critical Operation:
execTop() - Find and execute the task with highest priority, tie-breaking by highest taskId

This is the operation that drives our entire design choice!

# ü§î WHY NOT JUST USE A SIMPLE LIST?
Let's say we store all tasks in a simple list:

tasks = [
    {userId: 1, taskId: 101, priority: 10},
    {userId: 2, taskId: 102, priority: 20}, 
    {userId: 3, taskId: 103, priority: 15}
]

What happens with execTop()?
We'd need to scan EVERY single task to find the best one:

best_task = None
for task in tasks:
    if better_priority_or_tie_break(task, best_task):
        best_task = task
# O(N) time - slow if we have thousands of tasks!

Problem: Linear search is too slow for frequent execTop() calls!

# üîç WHY A HEAP?
A heap gives us instant access to the maximum element:

With a properly maintained heap:
# Get best task instantly!
best_task = heap[0]  # O(1) access to maximum!

But there's a catch...
Heaps are great for getting the max, but updating arbitrary elements is expensive (O(N) to find, then O(log N) to fix).

So we use the LAZY DELETION pattern we discussed!

# üéØ THE CORE INSIGHT
The key realization is:

We don't need to keep the heap perfectly clean at all times. We only need it to be correct WHEN we read from it.

Lazy Approach:
Push updates blindly into heap (even duplicates)
Mark items as invalid when removed/changed
Clean up lazily during reads - skip invalid items
This transforms expensive O(N) operations into amortized O(log N) operations!

# üìä Let's Compare Approaches
| Operation | Simple List | Heap (Naive) | Heap (Lazy) | |-----------|-------------|--------------|-------------| | Add | O(1) | O(log N) | O(log N) | | Edit | O(N) find + O(1) update | O(N) find + O(log N) fix | O(log N) push | | Remove | O(N) find + O(1) remove | O(N) find + O(log N) fix | O(1) mark | | ExecTop | O(N) scan | O(1) peek | O(k log N) lazy cleanup |

Where k = number of invalid items we skip (usually small)

# üß† MENTAL MODEL: Think of It Like a Restaurant Kitchen
Tasks = Orders coming in
Priority = How urgent each order is
Users = Different customers
Heap = The "hot shelf" where chefs grab the most urgent orders
Lazy deletion = Sometimes orders get canceled, but chefs only notice when they try to grab them
The chef doesn't constantly rearrange the shelf - they just skip canceled orders when they come up!

# üîÅ WHY NEGATIVE VALUES IN PYTHON?
Python's heapq is a min-heap (smallest item first), but we want max-heap behavior (largest first).

Clever trick:
# To simulate max-heap with min-heap:
heapq.heappush(heap, (-priority, -taskId))
# Now smallest negative = largest original values!

Example:

Priorities: [20, 15, 10]
Negatives:  [-20, -15, -10]  
Min-heap picks -20 first ‚Üí which represents priority 20!

# üéØ SUMMARY: Why This Design?
Heap ‚Üí Fast execTop() operations
Hash maps ‚Üí Fast lookups for add/edit/rmv
Lazy deletion ‚Üí Avoid expensive cleanup operations
Negative values ‚Üí Simulate max-heap in Python
This combination gives us the best of all worlds: fast everything!
