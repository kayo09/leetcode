i think the way i might go about solving this would basically be to iterate through the
nums array and append the diff (maximum - minimum) to a dictionary(keys
being the difference and values being a nums[i]). now
i would sort the dictionary in order of increasing differences, 

nvm i am clueless 
 
'''
class Solution(object):
    def minDifference(self, nums):
        maxs='0'
        maxs=maxs+'a'
        
        print(maxs)
        #for i in range(len(nums)):


    
solution=Solution()
nums=[5,3,2,4]
results=solution.minDifference(nums)
#print(results)
